    <div class="prog2">
        <p>Encouraging a culture of voluntary organ donation by creating awareness, educating the public, and facilitating easy and accessible means for individuals to register as organ donors.  Establishing clear guidelines and regulations to ensure that organ donation and transplantation processes are conducted ethically, transparently, and in compliance with international standards. Broadening the donor pool by specifying who can legally donate organs, potentially expanding beyond "near relatives" to include individuals who may be emotionally close to the recipient, making more organs available for transplantation.</p>

        <p>Establishing a fair and efficient system for organ allocation, giving priority to patients based on medical urgency, waiting time, compatibility, and other relevant factors, while addressing any disparities or biases.Implementing strict measures and penalties to deter illegal activities related to organ trafficking, commercialization, and unauthorized organ removal, ensuring the protection of vulnerable individuals.Encouraging and streamlining procedures for deceased organ donation, including provisions for the proper consent and authorization process, to increase the availability of organs from deceased donors.</p>
