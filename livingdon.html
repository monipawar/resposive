    <div class="prog2">
    <p>Living donation is a medical procedure in which a living person donates a part of their body, such as an organ or tissue, to another person in need of a transplant. This act of generosity is often a life-saving measure, enhancing the recipient's quality of life or extending their lifespan. The most common types of living donations involve organs like the kidney or liver, but tissue donations such as bone marrow, skin, and blood stem cells can also be donated while the donor is alive.</p>

        <p>The most usually transplanted organ and one that is most in need is the kidney. The function of the kidneys is to maintain the proper balance of bodily fluids by filtering waste and extra water from the blood. Those who are receiving dialysis owing to excessive blood pressure, diabetes, or cystic kidney disease may be candidates for a kidney transplant.</p>

    <div class="prog6">
        <ul>
            <li>Liver</li>

            <div class="prog7">
            <p>In addition to its more than 500 known functions, the liver also stores vitamins, carbohydrates, and fats and produces bile, which aids in digestion. Because the liver performs so many different tasks, donating one helps prevent chronic liver diseases like hepatitis or damage from drugs or alcohol. One donor may potentially save the lives of two recipients if their given liver is split between them on occasion.

                <div class="prog9">
                <p>In order for the body to operate properly, the lungs must remove carbon dioxide and extract oxygen. Lung transplants are frequently necessary for people with cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, emphysema, and pulmonary edema. Similar to the liver, a donor's lungs can save the lives of two other individuals.

                    <p>The pancreas is necessary for humans to regulate insulin. The pancreas makes the hormone insulin, which aids in the body's usage of glucose (sugar) for energy, as well as the digestive enzymes that break down fat, protein, and carbohydrates. The pancreas and kidney are frequently transplanted together because diabetes frequently affects both organs.</p>
