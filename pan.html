        <p>The exocrine portion of the pancreas produces digestive enzymes, including amylase, lipase, and proteases. These enzymes are essential for breaking down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the digestive system, aiding in the digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine.The pancreas secretes bicarbonate-rich pancreatic juice into the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). Bicarbonate helps neutralize the acidic chyme (partially digested food) from the stomach, creating a suitable environment for enzyme activity.</p>


        <p>The endocrine portion of the pancreas consists of specialized clusters of cells called islets of Langerhans. Within these islets, beta cells produce insulin, a hormone crucial for regulating blood glucose levels. Insulin allows cells to absorb glucose from the blood, lowering blood sugar levels.Alpha cells in the pancreatic islets produce glucagon, which acts in opposition to insulin. Glucagon stimulates the liver to release stored glucose into the bloodstream when blood sugar levels are low, helping to increase blood glucose levels.</p>
