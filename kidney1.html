        <p>The kidneys filter waste products, toxins, excess ions (e.g., potassium, sodium), and water from the bloodstream to form urine. This helps to eliminate these waste substances from the body.The kidneys regulate the balance of fluids and electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphate) in the body to maintain a stable internal environment, which is crucial for normal cell function and overall health.The kidneys produce erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Red blood cells are crucial for oxygen transport in the body.</p>


        <p>The kidneys produce erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Red blood cells are crucial for oxygen transport in the body.The kidneys convert inactive vitamin D into its active form, which is essential for the absorption of calcium and phosphate in the gut, necessary for bone health and other bodily functions.The kidneys help eliminate drugs, toxins, and metabolic waste products (e.g., urea, creatinine) from the body, aiding in detoxification and maintaining metabolic balance.</p>
