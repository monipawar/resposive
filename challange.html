        <p>The demand for organs far exceeds the supply. There is a persistent shortage of organs due to a lack of awareness, unwillingness to donate, and various legal and ethical concerns. Insufficient public awareness about the importance of organ donation, misconceptions, and lack of education on the process and benefits of organ donation deter potential donors and their families.</p>

        <p> In some countries, opt-in systems for organ donation are in place, where individuals have to actively register as donors. However, opt-out systems, where individuals are automatically considered donors unless they opt out, might help increase the donor pool. Even if an individual has consented to organ donation, family members can override the decision at the time of death, leading to a potential loss of donors.</p>

        <p>Ethical concerns and cultural beliefs about the sanctity of the body and religious perspectives on death and organ transplantation can influence an individual's decision or their family's decision to donate organs.Not all potential donors have organs suitable for transplantation due to medical conditions, age, or other factors, further limiting the pool of available organs.</p>
