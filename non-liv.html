    <p>Organs for transplantation can come from living doner and non-living doner both.brain dead people who, with their previous consent or the consent of their families, have chosen the selfless choice to donate their organs. Unfortunately, there are not nearly enough deceased donor organs available to perform transplants on everyone. The transplant community has worked hard in recent years to use every organ available from every donor.  Not every given kidney is ideal, but transplant physicians have long pondered if kidneys that weren't previously considered could be effectively used if they were paired with the correct recipients.

        <p>The heart can be transplanted to replace a failing or diseased heart in a recipient. Heart transplantation is typically reserved for severe cases of heart failure.</p>

            <p>Liver transplantation involves replacing a damaged or diseased liver with a healthy liver from a deceased donor. It is a common treatment for end-stage liver disease or acute liver failure.</p>

                <p>Lung transplantation is performed to replace damaged or diseased lungs, often due to conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, or other severe lung disorders.</p>
