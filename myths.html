    </div>

    <div class="prog2">
    <p>Organ donation is an important and life-saving act, but there are several myths and misconceptions associated with it. It's crucial to address these myths to encourage a better understanding of organ donation and promote informed decisions.</p>

            <li>Myth: Doctors won't work as hard to save me if they know I'm a donor.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

            <div class="prog4">
            <p>Fact: Medical professionals have a legal and ethical duty to save every patient's life. Organ donation is considered only after all efforts to save a person's life have failed.

                    <div class="prog7">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Myth: I'm too old or sick to donate organs.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>Fact: Age and certain medical conditions do not always disqualify you from being an organ donor. Each case is evaluated individually, and potential donors are assessed for their suitability based on medical criteria.</p>

                                    <p>Fact: Organ allocation is based on medical criteria, urgency, tissue matching, and waiting time. Socioeconomic status, fame, or wealth are not factors that determine organ allocation.</p>
