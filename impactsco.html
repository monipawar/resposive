            <li>Organ donation and transplantation</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

            <div class="prog4">
            <p>The Act established a legal framework for organ donation and transplantation, providing guidelines and regulations to govern the entire process. This regulation helps ensure the ethical and lawful procurement and allocation of organs, building public trust in the system.</p>

                </div>
        
                    <div class="prog6">
                    <p>By clearly outlining the legal and ethical practices related to organ donation and transplantation, the Act discourages illegal activities such as organ trafficking and commercialization of organs. It promotes fair and ethical practices within the healthcare system.</p>

                            <p>By providing a legal framework to facilitate organ donation and transplantation, the Act addresses the critical issue of organ shortage. It streamlines the process, making it more efficient and increasing the number of available organs for transplantation, ultimately saving lives.</p>
