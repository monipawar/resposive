        <p>Donating lungs, whether from a living donor (in very rare cases) or after passing away, can have significant and life-saving benefits for individuals suffering from severe respiratory conditions. Lung transplantation significantly improves the quality of life for recipients by restoring their ability to breathe properly and engage in physical activities, enhancing their overall well-being and daily functioning.Recipients often experience improved exercise tolerance and capacity after lung transplantation, allowing them to lead a more active and fulfilling life.Lung transplant recipients find relief from severe respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, chronic cough, fatigue, and limited physical activity.For individuals with irreversible lung diseases that cannot be managed effectively with medical treatments, lung transplantation is often the only viable treatment option.Lung transplantation helps restore proper oxygenation of blood and improves lung function, allowing recipients to breathe more effectively.</p>
